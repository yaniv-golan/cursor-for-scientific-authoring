# Minimal Paper Project Template (Copy Me)

This is a ready-to-copy starter for authoring a scientific paper with Cursor using a file-first workflow. Duplicate this folder outside of this repository for your paper project.

What’s inside
- `AGENTS.md`: minimal rules for safe, auditable agent edits.
- `claims.md`: a simple claims log for non-obvious statements.
- `manuscript/`: sections, figures, and tables intended for the paper.
- `data/`: raw and processed data folders (raw is read-only; don’t overwrite).
- `analysis/`: notebooks and exact scripts for any calculations.
- `references/`: bibliography files (e.g., `.bib` or CSL JSON) and notes.

Next steps
1) Open this project in Cursor.
2) Read `AGENTS.md` and adjust anything specific to your paper (title, acceptance checklist).
3) Start with `manuscript/sections/00-outline.md`, then follow the Quick Start and First Hour exercise.

Notes
- Keep edits file-scoped and small. Show diffs.
- For numbers, use code to calculate and save the script.
- Cite non-obvious claims and update `claims.md`.
