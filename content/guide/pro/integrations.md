# Integrations: Claude Code & OpenAI Codex

Draft. Clarify capability boundaries and trade-offs.

- When to use vendor IDE extensions alongside Cursor
- Built-in models vs extensions: custom keys can limit Agent features; extensions let you use provider subscriptions directly
- Extensions often work in Cursor; verify extension support on your build
- Leverage Claude Code skills via the extension; use Codex for complementary tasks
- Stay file-first and avoid fragmented context
