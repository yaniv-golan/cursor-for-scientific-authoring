# Agent‑Written Code with Minimal Coding

Draft. You need a runtime; approve executions consciously.

- Prompt patterns: “use code to calculate”; “show code and outputs”; “explain steps”
- Load data (CSV/TSV, Excel), clean, analyze, and plot to `analysis/figures/`
- Save Markdown tables for the manuscript
- Reproducibility: seeds, parameters, scripts; lock with `environment.yml` or `renv.lock`
