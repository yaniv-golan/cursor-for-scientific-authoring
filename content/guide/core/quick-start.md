# Quick Start (Vanilla Cursor)

Who this is for: researchers (including non‑coders) starting from zero; low‑code is optional.

Goal: produce an IMRaD outline and one table in 30–60 minutes using file-scoped prompts and safe, auditable edits with a clear preview of changes. An optional figure and export are available if you already have the tools.

What you’ll accomplish
- Create a minimal paper workspace (your own local folder).
- Draft an IMRaD outline from 3 PDFs with file-scoped prompts.
- Produce one table from a CSV. Figure is optional in the no‑code track.
- Run a quick citation audit against your quotations/summaries.
- Share Markdown by default; if you already have Pandoc, optionally export to DOCX/PDF for feedback.

Choose your track
- No‑code (default): stay in Markdown. Transcribe a CSV into a paper‑ready table; optionally create a simple figure using a spreadsheet (Numbers/Excel/Sheets) with step‑by‑step instructions generated by the agent. No local runtimes required.
- Low‑code (optional): let the agent generate and run Python/R to calculate statistics and save a figure. Recommended if you already have Python/R. See [Analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/analysis.md %}).

Prerequisites (Day‑0)
- Cursor installed and signed in; use default settings in Composer.
- Local folder chosen for your paper project.
- Optional for later analysis: Python or R; Pandoc; LaTeX (for journal‑style PDFs).

What is AGENTS.md (1 minute)
- A short, human-readable rules file at the project root that tells coding agents how to work safely on your paper (file‑first edits, citation rules, and acceptance criteria).

Copy‑paste minimal AGENTS.md
```text
# Project Agent Rules (Paper Title)

Scope: All files in this project.

How we work
- File‑first edits only. Make the smallest safe change and show a clear preview of changes.
- Keep edits in the target file(s) unless asked otherwise.

Accuracy & citations
- Ground non‑obvious claims in cited sources. Add footnotes and entries in `references/` and log key claims in `claims.md` (quote, paraphrase, source, link/DOI).
- Do not invent citations.
- If you compute any number, use code to calculate and include the code and outputs. Save scripts in `analysis/scripts/` and tables/figures in `manuscript/tables/` and `manuscript/figures/`.

Privacy & safety
- Do not send local files or data to external services unless explicitly approved.
- Ask before executing commands or installing packages.

Acceptance checklist (before finishing)
- Edits are file‑scoped with a clear preview of changes; citations present; numbers reproducible; paths consistent; next steps listed.
```

Glossary: zero‑jargon essentials (1 minute)
- File‑scoped prompt: a request that names the exact file(s) to read or edit so changes are constrained and reviewable.
- Clear preview of changes: a readable summary of what will change before it’s applied (you approve before writing).
- Claims log: a short list (`claims.md`) of non‑obvious statements with their sources, so you can verify later.

Minimal workspace (example). You can copy the ready‑to‑use template from the starter linked in [Quick Start]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/quick-start.md %}).

First-hour exercise (copy/paste into Cursor as file-scoped prompts)
1) Set project rules
   - Create `AGENTS.md` in your project root (or copy the minimal example from [Project Rules]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/project-rules.md %})). Keep it short.

2) IMRaD outline from 3 PDFs
   - Put three relevant PDFs into `data/raw/`.
   - Prompt (file-scoped):
     ```text
     Read the three PDFs in data/raw/. Extract: key research
     question(s), datasets, methods, and main findings. Draft an IMRaD
     outline in manuscript/sections/00-outline.md. Use footnotes for
     non-obvious claims and point footnotes to references/ or
     claims.md. For any direct quote, include page or section numbers.
     Keep all edits file-scoped and show a clear preview of changes.
     ```

3) One table from a CSV — choose your path
   - No‑code path (default):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped):
       ```text
       Read data/processed/example.csv and convert the first N rows and
       relevant columns into a clean Markdown table saved at
       manuscript/tables/example.md. Do not compute derived statistics
       yet. Add a short plain-language caption.
       ```
   - Low‑code path (optional):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped):
       ```text
       Propose changes first. Do not write files until I reply exactly:
       CONFIRM APPLY.

       Create analysis/notebooks/01-table.md that loads
       data/processed/example.csv, computes summary statistics with
       code, and writes a paper-ready Markdown table to
       manuscript/tables/example.md. Use code to calculate and show
       code and outputs. Save code under analysis/scripts/01-table.py
       (or .R).
       ```
       See [Analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/analysis.md %}).

4) Optional figure — choose your path
   - No‑code path (default):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped):
       ```text
       Write step-by-step instructions for making a [scatter/bar/line]
       chart from data/processed/example.csv in Numbers/Excel/Sheets
       (which columns, chart type, labels, units). Provide the figure
       caption text. I will create the chart manually and save as
       manuscript/figures/example.png.
       ```
   - Low‑code path (optional):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped):
       ```text
       Propose changes first. Do not write files until I reply exactly:
       CONFIRM APPLY.

       Create analysis/notebooks/02-figure.md that loads
       data/processed/example.csv and saves a figure to
       analysis/figures/example.png. Include code and the resulting
       plot preview; describe what it shows in plain language. Save
       code under analysis/scripts/02-figure.py (or .R). Set a random
       seed if randomness is used.
       ```

5) Citation audit
   - Prompt (file-scoped):
     ```text
     Scan manuscript/sections/ for quotations/paraphrases. For each,
     add a citation and a footnote pointing to references/ or
     claims.md. Flag any statement that lacks a source. Do not invent
     citations. Summarize gaps in claims.md.
     ```
     See [Accuracy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/accuracy.md %}) for details.

6) Export a shareable draft
   - If you have Pandoc: convert a merged Markdown draft to DOCX/PDF using your target journal’s CSL style. See [Writing in Markdown]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/writing-markdown.md %}) for options.
   - Otherwise: share the Markdown files directly.

Safety and accuracy guardrails
- File‑scoped prompts only; avoid long free‑chat that drifts context.
- No‑code path: limit to transcription (no derived stats). Mark any needed calculations as TODOs for Analysis.
- Low‑code path: for any derived numeric result, require “use code to calculate”, show code and outputs, and explain in plain language.
- Keep a simple claims log in `claims.md`; cite non‑obvious claims.
- Prefer local processing for sensitive data; review provider settings ([Data Governance]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link resources/data-governance.md %})).

Cross‑links
