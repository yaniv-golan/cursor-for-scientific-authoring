# Quick Start (Vanilla Cursor)

Goal: produce an IMRaD outline and one table in 30–60 minutes using file-scoped prompts and safe, auditable edits (with diffs). An optional figure and export are available if you already have the tools.

What you’ll accomplish
- Create a minimal paper workspace (your own local folder).
- Draft an IMRaD outline from 3 PDFs with file-scoped prompts.
- Produce one table from a CSV. Figure is optional in the no‑code track.
- Run a quick citation audit against your quotations/summaries.
- Share Markdown by default; if you already have Pandoc, optionally export to DOCX/PDF for feedback.

Choose your track
- No‑code (default): stay in Markdown. Transcribe a CSV into a paper‑ready table; optionally create a simple figure using a spreadsheet (Numbers/Excel/Sheets) with step‑by‑step instructions generated by the agent. No local runtimes required.
- Low‑code (optional): let the agent generate and run Python/R to calculate statistics and save a figure. Recommended if you already have Python/R. See Analysis (`content/guide/core/analysis.md`).

Prerequisites (Day‑0)
- Cursor installed and signed in; model selected in Composer.
- Local folder chosen for your paper project.
- Optional for later analysis: Python or R; Pandoc; LaTeX (for journal‑style PDFs).

What is AGENTS.md (1 minute)
- A short, human-readable rules file at the project root that tells coding agents how to work safely on your paper (file‑first edits, citation rules, and acceptance criteria).

Copy‑paste minimal AGENTS.md
```markdown
# Project Agent Rules (Paper Title)

Scope: All files in this project.

How we work
- File‑first edits only. Make the smallest safe change and show diffs.
- Keep edits in the target file(s) unless asked otherwise.

Accuracy & citations
- Ground non‑obvious claims in cited sources. Add footnotes and entries in `references/` and log key claims in `claims.md` (quote, paraphrase, source, link/DOI).
- Do not invent citations.
- If you compute any number, use code to calculate and include the code and outputs. Save scripts in `analysis/scripts/` and tables/figures in `manuscript/tables/` and `manuscript/figures/`.

Privacy & safety
- Do not send local files or data to external services unless explicitly approved.
- Ask before executing commands or installing packages.

Acceptance checklist (before finishing)
- Edits are file‑scoped with diffs; citations present; numbers reproducible; paths consistent; next steps listed.
```

First-hour exercise (copy/paste into Cursor as file-scoped prompts)
1) Set project rules
   - Create `AGENTS.md` in your project root (or copy from `content/templates/minimal-project/AGENTS.md`). Keep it short.

2) IMRaD outline from 3 PDFs
   - Put three relevant PDFs into `data/raw/`.
   - Prompt (file-scoped):
     - “Read the three PDFs in `data/raw/`. Extract: key research question(s), datasets, methods, and main findings. Draft an IMRaD outline in `manuscript/sections/00-outline.md`. Use footnotes for non‑obvious claims and point footnotes to `references/` or `claims.md`. Keep all edits file‑scoped and show diffs.”

3) One table from a CSV — choose your path
   - No‑code path (default):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped): “Read `data/processed/example.csv` and convert the first N rows and relevant columns into a clean Markdown table saved at `manuscript/tables/example.md`. Do not compute derived statistics yet. Add a short plain‑language caption.”
   - Low‑code path (optional):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped): “Create `analysis/notebooks/01-table.md` that loads `data/processed/example.csv`, computes summary statistics with code, and writes a paper‑ready Markdown table to `manuscript/tables/example.md`. Use code to calculate and show code and outputs. Save code under `analysis/scripts/01-table.py` (or `.R`).” See `content/guide/core/analysis.md`.

4) Optional figure — choose your path
   - No‑code path (default):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped): “Write step‑by‑step instructions for making a [scatter/bar/line] chart from `data/processed/example.csv` in Numbers/Excel/Sheets (which columns, chart type, labels, units). Provide the figure caption text. I’ll create the chart manually and save as `manuscript/figures/example.png`.”
   - Low‑code path (optional):
     - Prompt (file‑scoped): “Create `analysis/notebooks/02-figure.md` that loads `data/processed/example.csv` and saves a figure to `analysis/figures/example.png`. Include code and the resulting plot preview; describe what it shows in plain language. Save code under `analysis/scripts/02-figure.py` (or `.R`). Set a random seed if randomness is used.”

5) Citation audit
   - Prompt (file-scoped):
     - “Scan `manuscript/sections/` for quotations/paraphrases. For each, add a citation and a footnote pointing to `references/` or `claims.md`. Flag any statement that lacks a source. Do not invent citations. Summarize gaps in `claims.md`.” See Accuracy for details (`content/guide/core/accuracy.md`).

6) Export a shareable draft
   - If you have Pandoc: convert a merged Markdown draft to DOCX/PDF using your target journal’s CSL style. See Writing in Markdown for options (`content/guide/core/writing-markdown.md`).
   - Otherwise: share the Markdown files directly.

Safety and accuracy guardrails
- File‑scoped prompts only; avoid long free‑chat that drifts context.
- No‑code path: limit to transcription (no derived stats). Mark any needed calculations as TODOs for Analysis.
- Low‑code path: for any derived numeric result, require “use code to calculate”, show code and outputs, and explain in plain language.
- Keep a simple claims log in `claims.md`; cite non‑obvious claims.
- Prefer local processing for sensitive data; review provider settings (`content/policies/data-governance.md`).
