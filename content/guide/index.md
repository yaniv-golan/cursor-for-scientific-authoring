# Welcome

This guide shows researchers how to use Cursor (and peer coding agents) to draft, revise, and finish scientific papers. It assumes little to no programming background and keeps the on‑ramp no‑code by default, with an optional low‑code path for analysis.

Who this is for
- Researchers, students, and collaborators who write papers and want help structuring drafts, keeping sources organized, and producing figures/tables with less friction.
- Non‑coders are the primary audience. You can complete the first hour and early Core modules entirely in Markdown and spreadsheets.

What you’ll get
- Quick Start and a First‑Hour exercise to move from blank page to an IMRaD outline, one table, and a shareable draft.
- Templates and checklists that keep edits safe, auditable, and consistent.
- Best practices for accuracy (read–extract–cite, claims log) and, when you’re ready, an optional low‑code analysis track.

How to use this guide
- Core: Start with Quick Start, then Writing in Markdown, Accuracy, Managing Sources, and optionally Analysis.
- Plus: Add Git and branching when you want versioning and alternates.
- Pro: Explore MCP skills, integrations, and multi‑agent workflows later.

What to expect
- File‑first workflow: edits happen in files, not chat memory; you see diffs and can roll back safely.
- No‑code by default: produce structure, citations, and tables without installing runtimes.
- Low‑code optional: when you need calculations or plots, the agent can generate code and save it alongside your draft.

Prerequisites
- Cursor installed and signed in.
- A local folder for your paper project (you can copy the minimal template below).
- Optional (only for the low‑code path): Python or R; Pandoc/LaTeX for journal‑style exports.

Project starter (copy this)
- Minimal project template folder: `content/templates/minimal-project/`
  - Copy it outside this repository to start your paper.

Safety and accuracy at a glance
- Cite non‑obvious claims; keep a simple `claims.md` log.
- For derived numbers, use code to calculate and save both code and outputs.
- Prefer local processing for sensitive data; review data‑governance notes early.

Change log
- 2025-11-03: Initial overview page drafted for non‑coders; added scope, outcomes, expectations, and cross‑links; marked page complete.
