# Case Studies

Real projects that applied the file‑first approach for papers. Each case includes context, approach, outcomes, and lessons.

Submission criteria
- Scope: a bounded task (e.g., related work, methods, results) with concrete inputs and outputs.
- Evidence: artifacts (before/after diffs or previews), metrics (time saved, errors avoided), and peer feedback when available.
- Reproducibility: cite sources; if numbers are derived, use code to calculate and include code + outputs.

Narrative template
- Context: goal, constraints, and starting materials.
- Approach: file‑scoped prompts used and why they worked.
- Outcomes: what changed, how it was verified, and links to outputs.
- Lessons: what to repeat, what to avoid, and open questions.

How to contribute
- Fork or branch; add a new folder under `content/case-studies/` with a short slug (e.g., `lit-review-3-pdfs/`).
- Include a `README.md` with the narrative template above and any artifacts under `artifacts/`.
- Mark the case study `status: complete` only after a reviewer confirms citations and reproducibility notes.
