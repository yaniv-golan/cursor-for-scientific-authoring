# Content Workspace

Drafts that are not ready for publication live here. Organize documents using the same structure as the `docs/` directory to make promotion easy.

Suggested flow:

1. Ingest raw notes into the appropriate subfolder.
2. Create an outline or annotated draft.
3. Request feedback via pull request or discussion.
4. Move polished versions into `docs/`.
