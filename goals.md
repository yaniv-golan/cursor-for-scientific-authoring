# Project Goals

This playbook documents practical workflows for scientists who want to use Cursor and AI coding agents effectively. Early milestones:

1. **Establish scope** – define the personas, research domains, and tooling assumptions.
2. **Publish core workflows** – cover discovery, experimentation, analysis, and reporting use cases.
3. **Document best practices** – provide reproducibility, ethics, and governance checklists.
4. **Collect case studies** – highlight real-world examples from different scientific disciplines.
5. **Grow the community** – onboard contributors, encourage feedback, and share updates regularly.

The goals will evolve as the project matures. Update this document when priorities change.
