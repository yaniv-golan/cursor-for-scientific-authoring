# Cursor for Scientists

This repository collects and curates guidance on using Cursor and AI coding agents for scientific research. It hosts the public documentation site as well as supporting materials that help the community collaborate on the playbook.

## Repository layout

- `docs/` – public-facing documentation served via GitHub Pages.
- `content/` – in-progress drafts that are being shaped into polished docs.
- `raw/` – unedited source material captured from different AI systems.
- `assets/` – shared media (images, diagrams, downloads).
- `references/` – citation lists, glossaries, and external resources.
- `ops/` – project management artifacts such as decision logs.
- `.github/` – community health files (issue and PR templates).

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for ways to help. Please review the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` before participating.

## Publishing

GitHub Pages builds the site from the `docs/` directory using the Just the Docs theme. Configuration lives in `_config.yml` at the repository root.

## For agents (process summary)

- Read and follow `AGENTS.md:1`.
- Draft new guide content under `content/` and mirror to `docs/` when ready to publish.
- Use `raw/claims.md:1` as the fact-checked source of truth for non-obvious claims; add new claims there with sources or clearly labeled empirical notes.
- Plan sections using `content/reference-toc.md:1`.
