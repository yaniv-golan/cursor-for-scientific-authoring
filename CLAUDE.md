# CLAUDE.md

Include `@AGENTS.md` to reuse the same rules Claude Code should follow in this repository.

- @AGENTS.md
- Reference TOC for planning: @content/reference-toc.md

Prompting guidance for Claude Code:
- Always ground work in files (use @file for `AGENTS.md`, `content/reference-toc.md`, and target docs under `content/` or `docs/`).
- Draft in `content/`, publish in `docs/`, record non‑obvious claims in `raw/claims.md` (with sources or empirical notes).
- Do not edit files under `raw/` except `raw/claims.md`.
- Follow the incremental structure in the TOC; defer Git/MCP to later sections unless asked.
