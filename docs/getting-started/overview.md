# Getting Started

Use this overview to choose your path and jump in quickly. Non‑coders can complete the first hour without installs; add code later if needed.

What to do first
- Do the First Hour: create an IMRaD outline, one table, and a shareable draft with file‑scoped prompts.  
  [Start the First Hour →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link getting-started/first-hour.md %})
- Read the Quick Start: learn the core workflow, safety rules, and minimal project layout.  
  [Open Quick Start →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/quick-start.md %})

Who this is for
- Researchers and students who want precise, auditable drafts without wrestling tools.
- Non‑coders by default; low‑code analysis is optional when you need calculations or plots.

Prerequisites (Day‑0)
- Cursor installed and signed in; a local folder for your paper.
- Add `AGENTS.md` with basic rules; keep non‑obvious assertions in a simple `claims.md`.

Next steps
