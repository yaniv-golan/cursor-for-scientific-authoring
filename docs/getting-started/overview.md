# Getting Started

Outline the personas, prerequisites, and baseline setup required to use Cursor effectively in research environments. Draft content here or link to finalized sections once they are promoted from `content/`.

## Draft checklist

- Identify researcher personas and their goals.
- Document environment setup (Cursor installation, repo access, data handling policies).
- Provide a "first 30 minutes" quickstart scenario.
