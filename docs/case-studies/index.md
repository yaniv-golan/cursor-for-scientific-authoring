# Case Studies

Collect real-world stories describing how scientists apply Cursor. Each case study should follow a consistent template covering:

- Research domain and team structure.
- Cursor workflows used and why they were effective.
- Measurable outcomes and lessons learned.
- Constraints, failures, and mitigation tactics.

Coming soon: concrete case studies from early adopters in multiple domains. Interested in contributing one? Open an issue in the repository.
