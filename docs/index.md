# Cursor for Scientists

Welcome to the Cursor for Scientists playbook. This guide helps research teams combine Cursor, AI coding agents, and established scientific workflows to accelerate discovery while preserving rigor.

## How to use this site

- Getting Started: see {% link getting-started/overview.md %}
- Guide (Core/Plus/Pro): see {% link guide/index.md %}
- Workflows: see {% link workflows/index.md %}
- Case Studies: see {% link case-studies/index.md %}
- Resources: see {% link resources/index.md %}

We are building this playbook collaboratively. Contributions are welcome—see the repository README to get involved.

## How this guide is produced

- Drafts live in `content/` and are iterated until stable.
- Published pages live in `docs/` (this site), built by GitHub Pages.
- Agents and contributors should follow the reference TOC at `content/reference-toc.md` and the rules in `AGENTS.md`.

Note: this repository’s layout (docs/content/raw) is for producing the guide, not a template for research projects.

### Navigation / TOC

- The left sidebar is the full site table of contents generated from page front matter. On narrow screens it collapses behind the menu icon.
- Prefer the section links above for a quick jump, or browse via the sidebar TOC.

> Version info: see the {% link resources/about.md %} page for the current version and changelog.
