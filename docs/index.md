# AI agents for scientific writing

A developer tool, repurposed for research. Write faster with file‑first AI that shows every change before it lands. No code to start. AI agents code for you when you need numbers.

## Why scientists should care

Developers got faster because AI agents work on files, not vague chats and long manuscripts. The same idea applies to papers. Agents draft sections, track sources, create citations, and produce tables with previews you can audit.

**Before vs after**

| Old way | File‑first way |
|---|---|
| Chat window with memory drift | Named files with clear previews |
| Pasted text | Edits you can diff and roll back |
| Uncited facts | Read–extract–cite with a claims log |
| Hand‑computed numbers | “Use code to calculate” with saved outputs |

---

## What you get in your first hour

- An IMRaD outline from three PDFs  
- One clean table from a CSV  
- A shareable Markdown draft with citations  

Do this with the no‑code path. Add code later if needed.

## How it works

1. Create a simple project folder.  
2. Put a few PDFs and one CSV in place.  
3. Ask file‑scoped prompts that target exact files.  
4. Review a clear preview of changes. Approve. Done.

## Safety and accuracy

- Cite non‑obvious claims and keep a simple `claims.md`  
- For any derived number, use code to calculate and show outputs  
- Prefer local processing for sensitive data  
- Agents propose changes first. You approve before apply.

## Who this is for

Researchers, students, and collaborators who want less friction and more auditability. No programming required to start. AI agents do the coding for you when you need plots or stats.

---

## What you need

- Cursor installed and signed in  
- A local folder for your paper  
- Optional later: Python or R, Pandoc, LaTeX

## When you are ready for more

- Manage PDFs and notes so agents stay grounded  
- Let the agent write small analyses with code and save outputs  
- Add project rules in `AGENTS.md` to keep edits safe

[Manage sources →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/managing-sources.md %})  
[Run minimal analysis →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/analysis.md %})  
[Project rules →]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/core/project-rules.md %})

## What this is (plain language)

Cursor is a coding editor with AI agents that read and edit files. While built for coding, it doesn't really care what files it read and write. We repurpose it for science authoring using the versatile Markdown format because file‑first agents give precise, auditable drafts you control.
