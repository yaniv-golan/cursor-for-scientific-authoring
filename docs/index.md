# Cursor for Scientists

Welcome to the Cursor for Scientists playbook. This guide helps research teams combine Cursor, AI coding agents, and established scientific workflows to accelerate discovery while preserving rigor.

## How to use this site

- **Getting Started** introduces personas, setup steps, and quick wins.
- **Workflows** breaks down end-to-end research activities accelerated with Cursor.
- **Case Studies** showcases real-world narratives from the community.
- **Resources** gathers style guides, checklists, and reference material.

We are building this playbook collaboratively. Contributions are welcome—see the repository README to get involved.

## How this guide is produced

- Drafts live in `content/` and are iterated until stable.
- Published pages live in `docs/` (this site), built by GitHub Pages.
- The team maintains an internal claims catalog while authoring this guide. For your own projects, keep a simple `claims.md` at the project root to track non‑obvious assertions and their sources.
- Agents and contributors should follow the reference TOC at `content/reference-toc.md` and the rules in `AGENTS.md`.

Note: this repository’s layout (docs/content/raw) is for producing the guide, not a template for research projects.

> Version info: see the {% link resources/about.md %} page for the current version and changelog.
