# Workflows

Summaries of repeatable research activities where Cursor provides leverage (literature reviews, experiment automation, data analysis, compliance reporting, etc.).

Consider structuring each workflow with:

1. **Problem framing** – context, constraints, and desired outcomes.
2. **Cursor-driven approach** – prompts, agent setups, and iteration loops.
3. **Validation** – reproducibility safeguards, review steps, and hand-offs.
